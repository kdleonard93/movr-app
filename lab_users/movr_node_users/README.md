# Project Overview

This is the NodeJS backend implementation of the MovR 
Sample App built using TypeORM init with Express. 
This example will demonstrate how to integrate a Node/TypeORM 
implementation with CockroachDB to create REST API and 
utilize it with static front end built in React using 
create-react-app and Redux.


### Load CockroachDB
1. Create a CockroachDB cluster. 
Save the CRT file and take note of the host name, port, username used in your cluster.
   
2. Configure environment variables:
    Edit the .env file with your host, port, username, password, port and ssl certificate following the
    examples in the file. 

3. Initialize the database

    ~~~ shell
    .\db-setup.bat <db_url> (Windows PowerShell)
    .\db-setup.sh <db_url> (Mac/Linux)
    ~~~

    The "<db_url>" can be any CockroachDB or Cockroach Cloud instance.
    
### Application setup

    npm start
    ~~~
4. Navigate to the url [http://localhost:36257/](http://localhost:36257) 
    to use the application.


### Clean up
